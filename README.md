# IoT2 Project - The BredThr3ad

Hyde Park are a Montreal sewing company who have granted a 
significant number of immigrant women the opportunity to 
establish themselves in the Canadian economy and support 
their families when no one else would. One of these women 
happened to be my grandmother, Giuseppina Cicoria, who has 
been in the sewing industry ever since she arrived in Canada 
in 1958. She and many of her peers have expressed several times 
throughout their careers how irritating and timely constantly 
switching between sewing and measuring lengths could be and how 
there must be a more effective way at practicing their craft. 
That is where the inspiration for our company’s product arose. 
The ‘BredThr3ad’ is a tool that uses ultrasonic waves to calculate 
the distance travelled by a seamstress hand along a piece of clothing 
to ensure that they never have to put down their sewing tools for a metre 
stick ever again.
## Target Audience
Ideal Customer

BredThr3ad is a company going into the market with a target audience of all people who have the art of having sewing in their lives, whether that be through passion or profession. As a new to the scene organization however, it would be in our best interest to reach as many demographics as possible. That being said, one day enhancing our product to accommodate the world of woodworking could be a real possibility for our product as well.

To give an estimate as to which age group would likely be the substratum of our sales numbers however, we’d say it’s best to assume that: 
- Seamstresses/Seamsters 
-	Small clothing start-up companies
-	People of ages 65+

 would be our most active/highest selling customers.
